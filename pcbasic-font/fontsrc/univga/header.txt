#
#   The Basic Latin block was taken almost unchanged from DosEmu's vga.bdf. 
#   All the other blocks (except noted) were created mainly from scratch by me, 
#   Dmitry Bolkhovityanov. Letters in the Hebrew block were taken unchanged from
#   a public domain hebrew console font.
#
#   Glyphs in Arabic, Arabic Presentation Forms-A, Arabic Presentation Forms-B 
#   and U+262B Farsi symbol were kindly donated by Behdad Esfahbod.
# 
#   Thanks to Birger Langkjer for idea, to Mark Leisher for his wonderful 
#   XmBDFEd, and to many others for their support.
