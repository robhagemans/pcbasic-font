# The glyphs were mapped onto Unicode and converted to .HEX by Rob Hagemans.
#
# NOTES:
# - CPIDOS contains several glyphs that have no corresponding code point in
#   Unicode. These are not included in this file. Examples include
#   Georgian Mkhedruli capital letters, the z≈Çoty and forint signs, and
#   letters with multiple precomposed diacritics.
# - A choice has been made between multiple glyph variants included in CPIDOS
#   for some code points. In particular, for Greek glyphs, the variants from
#   the Greek codepages have been preferred over those from the Latin pages.
#   Some of those variants have found a home elsewhere, in particular at
#   MICRO SIGN (U+00B5) GREEK THETA SYMBOL (U+03D1) GREEK PHI SYMBOL (U+03A6)
#   GREEK LUNATE EPSILON SYMBOL (U+03F5).
# - The UniFont .HEX format only provides for 16-pixel-high glyphs, but is also
#   used here to encode a 14- or 8-pixel font. FOr those fonts, the last few
#   bytes of each glyph string should remain zero.
