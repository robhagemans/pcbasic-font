# AUTHORS:
#     Roman Czyborra created the original GNU Unifont, including the
#     .hex format. 
#
#     David Starner aggregated many glyphs contributed by others and
#     incorporated these into pre-2004 Unifont releases.
#
#     Qianqian Fang began his Wen Quan Yi font in 2004, by which
#     time work on Unifont had stopped.  Most of the almost 30,000
#     CJK ideographs in Unifont versions 5.1 and later were taken
#     from Wen Quan Yi with permission of Qianqian Fang.  The glyphs
#     in "./font/plane00/wqy-cjk.hex" are for the most part Qianqian
#     Fang's Unibit and Wen Quan Yi glyphs.
#
#     Paul Hardy drew most of the newly-drawn glyphs added to the BMP
#     from the Unifont 5.1 release to the present release.  This includes
#     the 11,172 glyphs in the Hangul Syllables block, plus approximately
#     10,000 additional glyphs scattered throughout the BMP.
#
#     Andrew Miller drew the glyphs added to Unicode 6.3.0.
